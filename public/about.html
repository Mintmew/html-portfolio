<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just a girl, sitting in front of a computer screen, taking a course to learn how to code so she doesn't have to do 
  admin work for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>I did not know that my projects would be on the literal internet. So, you're welcome. This is my first project :) </p>

<p>So far I have learned HTML Boilerplate, the Heading Element, Paragraph Element, Void Elements, List Elements, Nesting and Indentation, Anchor Elements, Image Elements, 
  Files Paths, and how to create multi-page websites!</p>
