<h1>The Best Movies According to Laura</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Gorg animation. I laugh. I cry. I stress. The food her parents are eating looks better than anything I've eaten in real life. 
   <p><b>Spoiler alert for a 24 year old movie o_o Like, go watch it already??<br /></b>
       "Haku, I've just remembered something. I think it might help you...when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river. 
       When I tried to get it back, I fell in. I thought I would drown, but the river carried me to shore. The river's name 
       was the Kohaku River. I think that was you! And your real name is Kohaku River!"<br /> 
       <i>Please, I am crying right now.</i> </p>
<h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
<p>Don't ask me why these depressing movies about children being forced to murder each other for rich people's entertainment and 
   as punishment for something their ancestors did is my comfort movie but everytime I'm sad I think, "you know what will cheer 
   me up?? Hunger Games. All 4 movies at once."</p>
<h3>Charlie's Angels (2000)</h3>
<p>This is the greatest fim ever made. It should have won Emmys, Grammy's, Oscars, Tony's. Humour, top tier. Acting, top tier. 
   Plot, top tier. Comedy, top tier. Action, top tier. Cinematography, top tier. Casting, top tier. Dialogue, top tier. 
   Dance sequences, top tier. The camera-work when Drew Barrymore realizes who the bad guy is? Iconic. They will never make another 
   movie as good Charlie's Angels, and I stand by that. </p>
